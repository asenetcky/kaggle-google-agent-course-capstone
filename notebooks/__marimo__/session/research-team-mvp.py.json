You'll only need plain Greek yogurt and optionally, some food coloring.\n\n**Here's how to do it:**\n\n1.  **Prepare the \\\"Paint\\\":** If you want colors, divide the yogurt into small bowls and add a few drops of different food coloring to each. Stir well. If not, plain white yogurt is also fun!\n2.  **Set Up:** Place your toddler in their high chair or on a protected floor area.\n3.  **Start Painting:** Spoon a small amount of yogurt onto the tray or surface.\n4.  **Explore:** Let your toddler use their fingers, a spoon, or a safe spatula to spread, swirl, and \\\"paint\\\" with the yogurt. Encourage them to feel the textures and play with the colors.\n5.  **Clean Up:** Once they're done, simply wipe the tray clean or give them a bath!\n\nRemember to always supervise your toddler during any craft activity. Have fun!\n",
