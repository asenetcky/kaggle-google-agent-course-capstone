This is my capstone project for the 
[Agents Intensive - Capstone Project](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/agents-intensive-capstone-project).

[5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google Course Page](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-agents)


Toddle Ops is an Agentic Concierge service to help exhausted parents and
caregivers create, manage and ✨deploy✨ toddler projects they can do with
their little ones.

## The Pitch

- TODO - just spitballing
- problem/solution/value
    - hard to come up with projects on a whim
    - static content: 
        - doesn't know what materials we have on hand
        - doesn't know what projects we've done already
        - has alot of fluff 
- quick projects
- clear consistant formatting everytime
- memory and database

## Usage

- TODO
    - uv
    - docker
    - vertex/adk cli etc...

### MCP

- [sqlite mcp server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/sqlite)

## Kaggle Capstone Objectives 🎯

This capstone project is an opportunity for you to apply what you've learned during the course week and submit it for evaluation.

- The high level process for a capstone project consists of:

    - Selecting a track:
        - Agents for Good 
            - Agents that tackle problems in education, healthcare, or 
            sustainability. 
    - Formulating a problem and solution pitch to which you will 
    build your agent. This will hone the objective of your project.
    - Developing and publishing the code for your agent publicly.
    - Being able to articulate the value of the agent by 
    preparing a writeup.
