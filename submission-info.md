# Capstone Submission

## Kaggle Capstone Objectives 🎯

This capstone project is an opportunity for you to apply what you've learned during the course week and submit it for evaluation.

- The high level process for a capstone project consists of:

    - Selecting a track:
        - Agents for Good 
            - Agents that tackle problems in education, healthcare, or 
            sustainability. 
    - Formulating a problem and solution pitch to which you will 
    build your agent. This will hone the objective of your project.
    - Developing and publishing the code for your agent publicly.
    - Being able to articulate the value of the agent by 
    preparing a writeup.
